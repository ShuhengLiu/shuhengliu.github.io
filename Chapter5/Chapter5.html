    <h2>5.1 The unstoppable movement after Shanghai reopen</h2>
    <p>
        Shanghai lockdown due to covid happened in March, 2022. Shanghai 
        reopened on 06/01/2022. After that, I could not control my internal 
        desire for sex. I began to seek for woman on dating apps such as Momo
        and Tantan. However, I could not find a woman who had the same 
        sex desire even if I uploaded my real picture on the apps. What I found
        was only massage girls and ktv girls. There are no girls who seek for free sex.
        Anyway, I went to see a massage girl Xiaoya to see if she could provide me with sex service.
        I went to her site to ask her for service and price. When I found she 
        does not give sex service, I said, "Let me go out and think for a while." And leave the site.

        My curiosity grows after I met one woman after another. One

        I feel terrible after whoring 
        Doctor H told me it was very unlikely to get HIV if I whore with a condomn. 
        He let me don't worry because stars and high officials play much
        more than we do. If HIV is so easy to get, the planet was destroyed very early.
        This disease spreads among gays and people who take drugs. I was relaxed after hearing his words.
        I ask my father for help: "I whored a call girl last Monday and 
        I am afraid I am infected with HIV. I cannot bear it by myself.
        Doctors say I have urethritis, dermatitis and adenolymphitis." He said he was astonished.
        And rushed to the hospital.
        I thought he would comfort me, saying something like whoring is safe as long
        as you wear condomns. Or let me take a good rest and take medications as doctors said.
        Instead, he asked me: "Why are you so bored?" "How much was it?" "600Yuan must carry disease."
