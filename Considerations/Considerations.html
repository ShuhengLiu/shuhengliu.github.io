        It is extremely nonsense to let a person to seize the day if he does not see
        a deadline. I understand a real deadline means someone will die at this time. If I 
        know I am going to die sometime tomorrow, one month later, one year later, or several
        years later, I am definitely going to seize the day and try to leave some indications
        about me, I am going to make a web page that describe my whole life, work hard on my 
        work at hand, I mean software on Gulfstream aircrafts. Because after I die, people will 
        remember me because of the works I did. Every Gulfstream pilot may use my software.
        Even if I die, my work is there.

        However, is it true that people cannot seize the day if they do not have a deadline?
        My school education made me form this kind of thought.
        When I was at Grade Six, for example, I seized the day to 
        spare no effort in studying school knowledge including Chinese, Math and English because
        they are tested two times per semester, mid-term and final. The grades will be cumulative
        to the Nine Grade affecting entering good or bad high school after graduation. 
        So what is the deadline? Ninth Grade graduation is the last deadline. And every mid-term and final
        are small deadlines. Besides, I have try your best to beat other classmates at the deadlines to ensure
        my overall ranking, so these deadlines make me work extremely hard. I spare no effort to study and beat
        my classmates.

        Now that I have graduated from top China college SJTU and top US college UofM. I don't see a 
        deadline. Or, I don't see where I need to work hard, until now, I know I may get disease like HIV and syphilis,
        or others I never heard of. Now I have the deadline. The deadline is the time when I am too sick to work.
        That may come tomorrow, a month later or 6 months later. So, now I have to work hard to put some signs in the world
        that I lived before.

        I gave up marriage because I was lazy. My parents do not proactively support my marriage with Z.
        She does not want to go back to China, but going to US again is hard for me if I apply again 
        for a MS/PhD degree. Or maybe I can go to 
        US after I marry with her and get green card. 
        (My mother told me do not get a green card by a woman...)
        All of these make me feel frustrated at the time being.
        Worrying about these stuff doesn't match I find a whore now or even later.

        If I don't see a deadline, I always want to lie on a bed and play video games, thinking my life
        is still long. I have plenty of time in the rest of my life. This time, actually, 
        I bet the call girl would let me seize the day by the health of my rest of life.
        Do you want to lie on the bed in the rest of the 60 years life or seize the day and work hard
        for 5 years and die? It seems I prefer the latter now.
