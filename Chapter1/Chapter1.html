<h1>Chapter 1 Childhood</h1>
<h2>1.1 Born</h2>
<p>
    I was born in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. I lived in 
    a two-bedroom apartment with my parents. My father Weicheng Liu told me it was hard to get
    married with my mother Yingzi Hu because my mother's father demanded he should have an apartment
    in downtown Jiading to marry my mother. However, my father was a rural guy.
    He had one elder brother Weijun Liu and one younger sister Shujian Liu. His family was poor. 
    His elder brother married in rural. My father's parents helped him pay part of this 
    two-bedroom apartment in downtown Jiading, which was very hard for them. 
    Then my father and mother were going to pay the rest as debt.

    My parents argue from time to time when I remember things. When I was young, I could
    not understand what they were arguing for. I also remember I was always scolded and beated
    by my parents. I remember at one night, I already went to bed, my parents came asked
    me: Did you brush your teeth? I said yes but actually I didn't. They went to the bathroom
    and touched my toothbrush, they found it was dry, then they scolded me and beat me hard.
    They said I was not allowed to lie. Even for small things like brush teeth. Same story
    happened when I didn't sort out my school bag but I said I did. Lieing is strictly prohibitted
    since I was a baby, so that I didn't know how to lie in my whole life. Is lieing a really 
    bad thing? I couldn't tell till now.
